//Events Module
Events Module
The Events module allows you to communicate between different parts of your application using events.

EventEmitter
An EventEmitter is an object that can send and receive events. Think of it like a radio station:

- When you want to send a message (event), you use the .emit() method.
- When you want to receive a message (event), you use the .on() method.

.emit() Method
The .emit() method sends an event to all listeners. It's like broadcasting a message on the radio:


const EventEmitter = require('events');
const radio = new EventEmitter();

radio.emit('music', 'Song is playing!');


In this example, we're sending a 'music' event with the message 'Song is playing!'.

.on() Method
The .on() method listens for a specific event. It's like tuning into your favorite radio station:


const EventEmitter = require('events');
const radio = new EventEmitter();

radio.on('music', (message) => {
  console.log(message); // Output: Song is playing!
});

radio.emit('music', 'Song is playing!');


In this example, we're listening for the 'music' event and logging the message to the console when it's received.


//INPUT-OUTPUT
INPUT
process.stdin.on('data', (userInput) => {
  let input = userInput.toString()
  console.log(input)
});
